	doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/279868},
	abstract = {Multitip probes are very useful diagnostics for analyzing and controlling the physical phenomena occurring in low temperature
	discharge plasmas. However, DC biased probes often fail to perform well in processing plasmas. The objective of the work was to
	deduce simple designs of DC biased multitip probes for parametric study of radio frequency plasmas. For this purpose, symmetric
	double probe, asymmetric double probe, and symmetric triple probe diagnostic systems and their driving circuitswere designed and
	tested in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) generated by a 13.56MHz radio frequency (RF) source. Using I-V characteristics of
	these probes, electron temperature, electron number density, and ion saturation current was measured as a function of input power
	and filling gas pressure. An increasing trend was noticed in electron temperature and electron number density for increasing input
	RF power whilst a decreasing trend was evident in these parameters when measured against filling gas pressure. In addition, the
	electron energy probability function (EEPF) was also studied by using an asymmetric double probe. These studies confirmed the
	non-Maxwellian nature of the EEPF and the presence of two groups of the energetic electrons at low filling gas pressures.},

	doi = {10.3938/jkps.68.482},
	abstract = {We develop Langmuir probes with different gains to measure the electron density in the lower
	ionosphere and thermosphere at altitudes of 200 − 380 km on board a CubeSat. These probes
	sweep over a wide range of voltage, but the data are acquired mostly in the electron saturation
	region, from which the electron density is calculated. The frequency of the voltage sweep is set at a
	high level (10 Hz) to reduce the effect of probe contamination. The probes are tested and calibrated
	in a laboratory chamber that simulates plasma densities similar to those of the lower ionosphere.
	We report here the measurement principles, system architecture, and test results},
